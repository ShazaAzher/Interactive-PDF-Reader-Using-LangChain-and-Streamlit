# Interactive PDF Reader Using LangChain and Streamlit

## Overview

This project focuses on building an interactive PDF reader that allows users to upload custom PDFs and features a chatbot for answering questions based on the content of the PDF. By leveraging technologies like LangChain, Streamlit, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5/GPT-4, we'll create a seamless user experience for interacting with PDF documents.

## Features

- **PDF Embeddings**: Creation of embeddings for PDF documents using Chroma.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Utilization of GPT-3.5/GPT-4 LLM for answering questions about the PDF content.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Development of a simple frontend using Streamlit for the chat app.
- **PDF Display**: Display of relevant pages from the PDF document in an iframe for context.
  
## Skills Required

- **Deep Learning**: Understanding of deep learning concepts.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Familiarity with NLP techniques.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Basic skills in crafting prompts for language models.
- **Python Programming**: Intermediate proficiency in Python programming.
- **Working with Streamlit**: Basic understanding of building web applications with Streamlit.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of working with Streamlit.
- Basic prompt engineering skills with LangChain.
- Intermediate Python programming skills.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI**: Utilized for GPT-3.5/GPT-4 language model capabilities.
- **Chroma**: Used for creating embeddings for PDF documents.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications.
- **LangChain**: Framework for prompt engineering and NLP pipeline implementation.

## Project Description

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) market has seen significant growth recently, largely driven by advancements in processing language at a semantic level in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3. This project capitalizes on this trend by creating an interactive PDF reader using LangChain and Streamlit.

The application allows users to upload PDF documents, after which a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5/GPT-4 LLM can answer questions based on the content of the PDF. Using LangChain, the chatbot looks up relevant text within the PDF to provide accurate responses. Additionally, relevant pages from the PDF are extracted and displayed to provide context for the answers.

Streamlit is used to develop the web application, while HuggingFace models assist in creating embeddings for the PDF content. LangChain facilitates the NLP pipeline implementation, allowing for seamless integration of the chatbot into the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip.
3. Set up the required configurations.
4. Run the Streamlit app and start interacting with the PDF reader.
